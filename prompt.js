### RareCyte Front End Developer Coding Challenge

# Reactive Client for NASA Images

Implement and submit a small single page app web client against the NASA Image and Video Library:
https://images.nasa.gov/ (All NASA APIs: https://api.nasa.gov/, 
Image and Video Library APIs documentation: https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf)

Your client should use a reactive modern Javascript framework (we use Vue.js at RareCyte but 
its not a requirement for this challenge). 

Your client should display a table of entries and details for a 
selected entry from the table. Details for every entry should include at least one image and 
some of its metadata. 

Your solution should include a github link to your web client along with instructions
on how to install, test and run it. Send the link to pvarshavskaya@rarecyte.com 

Just display a table of images that you can get with their API (your choice of images, your choice of which of them to show), and allow the user to select one, at which point the app will display the image and some of its metadata.
