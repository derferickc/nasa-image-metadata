### RareCyte Front End Developer Coding Challenge

# Reactive Client for NASA Images

Implement and submit a small single page app web client against the NASA Image and Video Library:
https://images.nasa.gov/ (All NASA APIs: https://api.nasa.gov/, 
Image and Video Library APIs documentation: https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf)

Your client should use a reactive modern Javascript framework (we use Vue.js at RareCyte but 
its not a requirement for this challenge). 

Your client should display a table of entries and details for a 
selected entry from the table. Details for every entry should include at least one image and 
some of its metadata. 

Your solution should include a github link to your web client along with instructions
on how to install, test and run it. Send the link to pvarshavskaya@rarecyte.com
